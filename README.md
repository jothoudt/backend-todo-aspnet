# backend-todo-aspnet

This is one of the REST API applications for my to-do list. It allows the user to GET, POST, DELETE, and UPDATE tasks. This is my first time working with C# and it is just to get some practice. The front-end of this application can be found at [front-end to-do](https://github.com/jothoudt/frontend-to-do).
